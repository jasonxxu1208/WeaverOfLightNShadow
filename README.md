### Weaver of Shadow and Light ###
**Unreal Engine 5 | C++ & Blueprint Gameplay Systems | First person puzzle action**
## Project Overview
Weaver of Light & Shadow is a first-person puzzle-action game developed in Unreal Engine 5 using C++ and Blueprints, where light functions as both a traversal mechanic and a combat resource. Players wield a magical wand to interact with torches, cast powerful light spells, and defeat enemies while navigating environments shaped by illumination.

The project focuses on systems-driven gameplay, emphasizing real-time light evaluation, modular spell logic, and state-based AI behavior.
